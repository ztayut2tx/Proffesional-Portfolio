                <p>My name is Zachary Taylor.  I am a junior full-stack web developer in the making.  I am currently living and working out of Seguin, TX.  However, I am from Kaysville, UT and moved out here to Texas in 2016.  After six long years of being in  multi-family facility maintenance I decided it was time to make a change.  I started looking into web development as i have always enjoyed working with computers and new and old tech alike.  It was very intimidating going back to school to learn new skills but, as i quickly found it’s like riding a bike.
                  </p>
                
                <p>My goal once school is finished is, to quickly transition into the industry with a full time job in the field.  Utilizing skills gained not just with technologies but with people.  Teamwork is definitely something that i thrive within and as i am learning, it is a vital part of the web developers everyday life.  My goals from there out include starting my own side business and eventually evolving to a freelance web developer with a long list of clients.
                  </p>

                <p>
                  I look forward to applying these skills in a variety of way’s to meet customer needs and help design and develop applications that will help people live more fun, efficient, and tuned in day to day lives. The future is bright!
