# Strapping-On-My-Bootstrap

# Description
This is my first major project utilizing html,css, and bootstrap.  It is a basic portfolio structure that is utilizing responsive images and grid layouts.  Using my knowledge from class and bootstrap i was able to bring this page to life and im pretty proud of it.

# Usage
Ideally this is the platform from which i will apply for jobs in the industry and or start freelancing.

# Roadmap
This is the base work of what will eventually be an extensive portfolio catalogging my skills and applications.

# Acknowledgements
My instructors,peers,tutors and bootstrap formats.

# Project Status
For the time being this is done but this will be re-visited and fine tuned in the near future.
